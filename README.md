# Course 4
In this assignment we generate 4 plots from four different scripts. Each time data is loaded thus making each script fully independent.
Data are loaded initially and then a subset for two days is extracted from which energy consumption graphs are generated.
The graphs are saved in working directory by keeping dev.off()
